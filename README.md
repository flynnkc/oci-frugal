# OCI Frugal

The purpose of this software is to run a program that can start and stop paid OCI services on a schedule. Tuning resources to run only when needed can lower costs associated with running cloud services. Using the lightweight threading tools provided by the Go language, scaling will be done in an efficient, timely manner.
